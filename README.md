## Introduction

## Installation Guide

To run the Lemonade Flutter app, you need to set up a `.env` configuration file containing the required variables. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following variables to the file and replace `<OAUTH_URL>` and `<CLIENT_ID>` with your credentials:

```env
OAUTH2_BASE_URL=<OAUTH_URL>
OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=<CLIENT_ID>
```

### Build and run the app with Flutter

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. If you haven't enabled Flutter on your machine, visit the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and follow the instructions for your operating system.
3. Ensure you have the appropriate Flutter devices set up by running `flutter devices`. If no devices are found or configured, follow the [device setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
4. Run the app by executing `flutter run`.

With the `.env` file configured and the app built and run via Flutter, you can now successfully use the Lemonade Flutter app.

## How to obtain the debug.keystore

The debug.keystore is a crucial file required for Android app development and debugging in Flutter projects. To ensure security, this file should not be publicly shared or included in version control.

If you need access to the debug.keystore for this project, please contact the engineering team responsible for project management. They will provide you with the necessary file for your development purposes.
