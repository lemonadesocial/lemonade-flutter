# Lemonade Flutter App

## Introduction

## Installation Guide

To run the Lemonade Flutter app, you need to set up a `.env` configuration file containing the required variables. Follow the steps below:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following variables to the file and replace `<OAUTH_URL>` and `<CLIENT_ID>` with your credentials:

```env
OAUTH2_BASE_URL=<OAUTH_URL>
OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=<CLIENT_ID>
```

### Build and run the app with Flutter

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. If you haven't enabled Flutter on your machine, visit the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and follow the instructions for your operating system.
3. Ensure you have the appropriate Flutter devices set up by running `flutter devices`. If no devices are found or configured, follow the [device setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
4. Run the app by executing `flutter run`.

With the `.env` file configured and the app built and run via Flutter, you can now successfully use the Lemonade Flutter app.
