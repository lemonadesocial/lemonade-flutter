  <h1 align="center" style="font-size: 48px;">üìõ Flutter Mentions</h1>
  <h5 align="center">A simple flutter input widget to add <code>@</code> mentions functionality to your app</h5>
</p>

## Install üì¶

To use this package, add `flutter_mentions` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

You will need to add `flutter_mentions` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_mentions:
```

Then, run `flutter packages get` in your terminal.

## Usage üíª

To use this package you must first wrap your top most widget with `Portal` as this package uses `flutter_portal` to show the suggestions list.

> [Portal], is the equivalent of [Overlay].
>
> This widget will need to be inserted above the widget that needs to render
> _under_ your overlays.
>
> If you want to display your overlays on the top of _everything_, a good place
> to insert that [Portal] is above `MaterialApp`:
>
> ```dart
> Portal(
>   child: MaterialApp(
>     ...
>   )
> );
> ```
>
> (works for `CupertinoApp` too)
>
> This way [Portal] will render above everything. But you could place it
> somewhere else to change the clip behavior.

**1. How do I can access to the the editing controller?**
A. To get the control of `TextEditingController` just use a Global key more info can be found here [#13](https://github.com/fayeed/flutter_mentions/issues/13). This will also allow you to access the `text` & `markupText`.

**2. How do I search users as I type?**
A. Just use the `onSearchChange` to get the currrent search text & make request to the server and later update the data.

**3. What is the need of Portal?**
